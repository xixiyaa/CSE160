Starting the Game

Click the “Start Mini Game (Part 13)” button. Once the game starts, you’ll see random shapes (squares, triangles, or circles) begin to appear on the canvas.
Objective

Click (or “whack”) each shape before it disappears to score +1 point.
How It Works

Spawning: A new shape appears on the canvas every 0.6 seconds. Each shape has a random size, color, and location.
Lifespan: Each shape vanishes automatically about one second after it appears—so there’s only a short window to click it.
Scoring: Every time you successfully click on a shape (i.e., inside its bounding area), the shape is removed and your score increments by one. The current score is shown next to “Game Score:” at the bottom of the controls panel.
Game Over: After 30 seconds, the game stops spawning shapes and pops up an alert with your final score.
Tips for Graders

When “Start Mini Game” is active, the normal painting functionality is disabled. Clicking on the canvas no longer draws new shapes; instead, it attempts to detect (and remove) the spawned shapes.
Your score is displayed in real‐time under “Game Score:”. After the 30‐second timer expires, an alert will appear saying “Game Over!” plus your final score.
You can play multiple rounds by clicking “Start Mini Game” again.
